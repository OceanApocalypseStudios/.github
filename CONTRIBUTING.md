# Contributing to OceanApocalypseStudios Projects
Thank you for your interest in contributing!

OceanApocalypseStudios is a small two-person team focused on open-source-first projects.  
Here’s how to contribute effectively and respectfully:

---

## What We Expect

- Contributions **only** via open-source projects.  
- Collaborative pull requests, issues, and feedback are welcome!  
- Respect the project's scope and don’t request to join the core team - this includes asking for roles at OceanApocalypseStudios.
- Keep contributions aligned with the existing project style and guidelines.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to.  
2. Make changes in a feature branch.  
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.  
4. Engage respectfully with any review feedback.

## What We Don’t Do

- We do **not** accept requests to join OceanApocalypseStudios or gain official roles.  
- Closed-source projects are, as the name implies, not open for discussion or contributions.

Thanks for helping us build great open-source software!
